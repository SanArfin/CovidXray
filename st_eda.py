## EDA

What copilot suggests
> Class distribution analysis (bar plots, tables showing data frequency across classes).  
Statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation of pixel intensities).  
Histogram analysis (distribution of brightness levels in images).  
Boxplots (comparing pixel intensity ranges among classes).  
Sample visualizations (example images showing differences in contrast, artifacts).  
Feature correlations (if applicable, checking pixel intensity variation across classes).  
Potential biases uncovered (for example, some classes might consistently have lower-quality images due to their source).  
Why Itâ€™s Needed: EDA helps identify underlying trends and anomalies in the dataset that might influence model performance. It informs preprocessing decisions and later supports model validation.

----

TODO: some parts may already be mentioned in "dataset" section. 

----

TODO: possibly main "thing" to add in EDA is, to answer what copilot has as last sentence:
* identify underlying trends and anomalies in the dataset that might influence model performance
* informs preprocessing decisions and later supports model validation

----

TODO: if "dataset" and "preprocessing" sections already answers all this -> remove "EDA" page completely
